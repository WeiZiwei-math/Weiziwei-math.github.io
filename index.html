<hr>
I am a student at School of Mathematics of Shandong University starting from Sept 2020. I was a student at School of Energy and Power Engineering of Shandong University during Sept 2019-June 2020.
Here is my <a href="https://weiziwei-math.github.io/CV.pdf">CV</a>.

<h3>
Study Interests
</h3>
  
<ul>
I am interested in the geometric representation theory and mathematical physics, especially quantum groups, quiver varieties and mathematical gauge theories(But I know very little about them for now). I am also interested in algebraic geometry, semi-classical analysis, and many other mathematics inspired by theoretical physics.

</ul>

 
<h3>
Undergraduate Learning Seminar
</h3> 

<ul>
I am planning to organize a learning seminar in representation theory during the next semester(Fall 2022). Here are some possible topics. 
<br>
<br>
<li> Representation theory of Lie algebras.
 
<li> Representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras and quivers.
 
<li> Combinatoric representation theory, e.g. the Okounkov-Vershik approach of representation theory of the symmetric groups and symmetric functions, Coxeter groups, etc.

<li> ...(Tell me if you have any other recommend topics.)
<br>
<br>
If you are interested and would like to join in this seminar, please email me(or QQ, wechat). Any suggestions and questions are welcomed.
 </ul>
