<h1>Welcome to Ziwei Wei's homepage!</h1><p>

<hr>
I am a student at School of Mathematics of Shandong University starting from Sept 2020. I was a student at School of Energy and Power Engineering of Shandong University during Sept 2019-June 2020

<h3>
Study Interests
</h3>
  
<ul>
I am interested in the geometric representation theory and mathematical physics, especially quiver varieties and Coulomb branches of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories(But I know very little about them for now). I am also interested in algebraic geometry, semi-classical analysis, and many other mathematics inspired by theoretical physics. And I am also willing to study geometric Langlands.

</ul>

Course notes
</h3> 
 
Here are some notes I typed.
 
<ul>
<li>  Fundamental of Number Theory (Spring 2022)
<br>
<br>
Lecturer: Prof. Zhao Lilu
<br>
<br>
Ref: Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory by Feng Keqin (in Chinese)
<br>
<br>
This is a one semester course about number theory. The main goal of this course is to introduce some basic number theory via undergraduate level mathematics, say complex analysis, abstract algebra, etc.
The course will contain the basic theory of analytic number theory, algebraic number theory and (if time permitted) combinatoric number theory.
