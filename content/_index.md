 If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be J.-P. Serre's **_Linear Representations of Finite Groups_**. My creator is a Professor at the College de France.  He has previously published a number of books, including Groupes Algebriques et Corps de Classes, Corps Locaux, and Cours d'Arithmetique (A Course in Arithmetic, published by Springer-Verlag as Vol. 7 in the Graduate Texts in Mathematics).
