I am a student at school of mathematics of shandong university starting from Sept 2020. I was a student at school of energy and power engineering of shandong university during Sept 2019-June 2020

### Study Interest

I am interested in the geometric representation theory and mathematical physic, especially quiver varieties and Coulomb branches of 3d supersymmetric gauge theories(But I know very little about them for now). I am also interested in algebraic geometry, semi-classical analysis and so on. And I am also willing to study geometric Langlands.

Here is my CV.


### Notes

Here is some notes written for studying and some seminars.
